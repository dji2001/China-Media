  <h1>China Foreign Coverage Explorer</h1>

  <p>
    This website provides an interactive interface to explore the data from the paper:
    <strong>“Domestic Politics and Editorial Control Over Foreign News Coverage in the People’s Daily, 1993–2022”</strong><br>
    <em>by Jianbing Li, Jiakun Jack Zhang, Duoji Jiang, and Weifeng Zhong</em><br>
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10670564.2025.2486329" target="_blank">Journal Version</a><br>
    <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/research/working-papers/chinas-domestic-politics-and-editorial-control-over-foreign-news-coverage" target="_blank"> Open-source Preprint</a>
  </p>

  <h2>About the Project</h2>
  <p>
    This project investigates how domestic political dynamics in China—especially power consolidation among top leaders—affect foreign coverage in the country’s most important state newspaper, the <em>People’s Daily</em>. Surprisingly, as China's global presence expands, the amount of foreign coverage in its flagship paper has decreased significantly under Xi Jinping’s administration.
  </p>

  <p>
    To support this research, we developed the <a href="https://github.com/dji2001/China-Media" target="_blank">CFC Database</a>, which records the number of articles referencing specific countries (defined as having the country keyword appear more than twice), their proportion relative to the total number of articles each year, and supplementary data such as trade volumes and leadership visits. This dataset enables users to explore trends in the frequency of different countries’ appearances in Chinese state media.
  </p>

  <h2>Explore Country Mentions</h2>
  Use the interactive plot below to visualize how frequently a country of your choice was mentioned in the <em>People’s Daily</em> from 1993 to 2022. <br>
  1. Use the slider at the bottom of the chart to select a specific range of years to view. <br>
  2. Double-click on a country name in the legend to isolate its line; then click other names to add or remove countries for comparison.
